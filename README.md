# hello-world

Hello, I am Michael-Shawn Bishop. I am a fan of tech, both new and old, and seek to 
start collecting old tech as well as help build computers for other people.

Assuming things go smoothly, I am expected to graduate at the end of this semester, and 
(finally) be able to work (I hope!).
